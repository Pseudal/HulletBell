    "What's next, watch out, tears!"? Well...

    This mod is a modification of the "Hullet bell" mod from Anumania without the original mod item, and the effect enabled, by default.

    This mod does exactly what the title says, it adds a little marker "supposed" to be the actual hitbox of the enemy projectiles.
    Allowing for easier information acquisition and dodging.

    This is only effective on projectiles! not entities.

    Mod compatible with ModConfigMenu and adds some options, like disabling the player's hitbox.
